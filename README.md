🚦 2025 Islander Hackathon Project: Corpus Christi Road Construction AI 🧠💻

For the 2025 Islander Hackathon, our team developed a program addressing the ongoing issue of road construction across Corpus Christi. 🏗️

This project leverages AI-powered APIs 🤖 to detect and help users avoid construction zones throughout the greater Corpus area. By improving public awareness of road closures, the system aims to reduce traffic congestion 🚗💨 and enhance commute efficiency 🚦.

Our solution performs a valuable civic service 💼 by integrating the capabilities of OpenAI 🧠 and Geocode 🗺️ APIs, combining intelligent language processing with geospatial mapping technology.

One of the most challenging obstacles encountered during development was managing false positives ⚠️ produced by OpenAI’s API when interpreting Geocode data. This issue proved difficult because the two systems did not initially integrate as smoothly as anticipated.

Looking ahead 🔭, our team plans to further refine and expand the project to achieve its full potential. Due to the limited timeframe ⏳ of the hackathon, we simplified certain planned features to ensure a functional and efficient prototype. Despite these adjustments, we remain committed to continuing development and realizing our complete vision for this application. 💪✨
